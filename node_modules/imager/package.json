This would be the complete url of the image\n\n1. **Form upload (multiple images)**\n\n  If you are using express, you will recieve all the form files in `req.files`.\n\n  ```js\n  imager.upload([req.files.image], function(err, cdnUri, files) {\n      // do your stuff\n  }, 'items')\n  ```\n\n  Here, `items` is your scope or variant. If you don't specify the scope or the variant, imager\n  will try to look for a default variant named `default`. You must either specify a variant like\n  above or provide a `default` variant.\n\n  ONLY WORKS WITH S3\n  If you add an uploadDirectory field to the imager config file as shown in imager-config-example.js, the files uploaded will go into that specific folder rather than the root of the bucket.\n  If you leave out the uploadDirectory field, uploads will default to the root of the bucket.\n\n2. **Upload local images**\n\n  ```js\n  imager.upload(['/path/to/file'], function (err, cdnUri, files) {\n    // do your stuff\n  }, 'items')\n  ```\n\n  Here files can be an array or a string. Make sure the path is\n  absolute.\n\n### Removing file(s)\n\n```js\nvar files = ['1330838831049.png', '1330838831049.png']\nimager.remove(files, function (err) {\n  // do your stuff\n}, 'items')\n```\n\n`files` can be array of filenames or a string of single filename.\n\nEven here, if the variant is not specified, imager will try to look for the `default` variant. If neither\nof them are provided, you will get an error.\n\n### Gotchas\n\n1. If your bucket name contains dot(s) make sure you set `secure: false`, otherwise\nyou will run into [this](https://github.com/LearnBoost/knox/issues/125).\n2. Setting the `keepNames: true` for the variant retains the name of the uploaded file; otherwise you can set your custom rename function for each variant (check the example imager config)\n3. If you specify `debug: true` in the imager config, you can see the logs of uploaded / removed files.\n4. If you want to upload the original image, use \n\n    ```\n    resize: {\n        original: \"100%\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n## Tests\n\n```sh\n$ npm test\n```\n\n## License\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Madhusudhan Srinivasa < [madhums8@gmail.com](mailto:madhums8@gmail.com) >\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
